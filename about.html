    <h2 style="color: white; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 100;">Spaghetti Code LLC first started off as an idea. An idea to embark on a journey, a journey where passion meets purpose, where the ordinary is transcended by the extrordinary. 
        Formed in our 7th grade year, Spaghetti Code LLC has made that idea a reality, using innovation and teamworkto propel our dream to new heights. 
        Throughout our journey, we have had remarkable growth. Starting from humble begginnings working with simple HTML 5 and Javascript games, Spaghetti Code LLC has matured into something much more.
        Our projects include a both a Congressional App Challenge 1st place and runner-up submission, working with object detection AI at NASA, creating a mobile app in collaboration with West Virginia University for Negotiation Planning, submitting in the 2024 NASA App Challenge, working on the JPL Sunrise Mission, gaining field experience deploying high altitude weather balloons with payloads we designed during solar eclipses, and more.
        <br><br>
        Even with all these projects under our belt, we are still looking for more. If you have aspirations for developing your own mobile app or website, Spaghetti Code LLC is here to help. If you are considering getting consulting or an application built, please contact us at cac.pogg@gmail.com.
